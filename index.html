# Swarms
## "Thinking Inside the Box"
#### Matthew Richardson
</section>


<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## Swarming Behaviour

> A process where the queen bee leaves the colony with a large group of worker bees to set up a new hive elsewhere.

Notes:
* I assume you all know what a swarm is and the purpose of swarming
</section>


<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
	## Who's in a Swarm?
* Old (scout) bees
* Young (nurse) bees

Notes:
* Old scouts needed to find a new location
* Long life expectancy (delay til new brood emerge)
* Original colony has emerging brood to replace old bees
* Young bees better at cleaning, wax building, brood rearing
* Not oriented to original site, so less drift/losses later

</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## What Triggers Swarming?
#### Main factors
* Age &amp; Vigour of Queen
* Colony Size &amp; Congestion (brood nest)

#### Additional factors
* Honey Flow
* Presence of Drones
* Strain (carnica vs mellifera)
* Weather


Notes:
What you see is the above, but in reality, biological explanation in form of
queen footpr2int pheremone - Arnhardt glands/tarsal glands
* congestion: queen can't move, workers rub off pheremone, honey-bound frames not visited
* old queens produce less pheremone
* heavy flow - bees switch from rearing to storing, less queen activity, more time on honey frames
* end of flow - bees are bored!

## Swarm Management

## Why Manage Swarming?
* Avoid losing bees, honey &amp; productivity
* Provide increase
* Avoid upsetting the general public
* _Stop me getting so many phone calls!_

## How to Deal with Swarming
* Cut out queen cells whenever you see them <!-- .element: class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out" -->

* Cut out queen cells whenever you see them <!-- .element: class="fragment step-fade-in-then-out" style="text-decoration: wavy red line-through;" -->

Notes:
At best you buy yourself a few days.
Generally a bad idea:
* What if you miss one?
* What if these are supersedure/emergency cells?
* What if they swarm anyway and leave no larvae behind?
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## Swarm Prevention

> Methods to suppress or delay the onset of swarming.

* Young, strong queens
* Space (adding boxes, or removing bees)
* Strains, selection and breeding
* Reversing/Checkerboarding

Notes:
* Never really prevention - more delaying the inevitable!
* Young queens, more pheremone, less swarms
* Avoid congestion - rule of 7s OR take bees out
* Choose non-swarmy bees, by strain and/or by breeding
</section>


<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## Swarm Control

> Methods to deal with swarming when it has already begun.
</section>


<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## Swarm Control Methods

### Common Features
* Separate Bees from the Queen or the Brood
* Reduce the number of bees
* Give the bees something to do

### Variations
* Single or Multiple Visits Required?
* Horizontal or Vertical Splits?
* Increase or not?
* Disruption of Brood Rearing or Honey Production?

</section>


<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## The Standard ('Pagden') Method
1. The old hive is moved to a new site (to one side of the old site).
2. A new hive with empty frames is placed on the old site.
3. The Queen is moved to the new hive, and supers added (if present).
4. Flying bees return and join the queen.

Notes:
Single, Horizontal, Increase, Disruption
* Simplest method.
* No timings to worry about.
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## The Heddon Method

_steps 1-4 from the Standard Method, then..._

1. One week later, the old hive is moved to the other side of the old site.
2. Newly emerging flying bees drift into the original site.

Notes:
* Extra (physical!) step.
* Improves foraging, but risky if stores low
</section>


<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## The Demaree Method

1. Move the brood box to one side.
2. Place a new brood box on the floor containing drawn comb.
3. Transfer the Queen and 1-3 frames capped brood into it.
4. Add a Queen Excluder and 2 supers.
5. Add the original brood box.
6. After 5-6 days, destroy Queen Cells in top box.

Notes:
Multiple (easy), Vertical, No Increase, No Interruption
* Flexible routes (can increase).
* Needs supers present for Q separation.
* Must have some drawn frames or bees will only work supers!
* Can keep swapping boxes if repeated swarm signs
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## The Snelgrove Board

![Snelgrove Board](img/snelgrove-board.jpg "Snelgrove Board")

</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## The Snelgrove Method (I)

1. Move the brood box to one side.
2. Place a new brood box on the floor containing drawn comb.
3. Transfer the Queen and 1-3 frames capped brood into it.
4. Add the Snelgrove Board, with top-left door open.
5. Day 4-5: Close top-left, open bottom-left and top-right.
6. Day 9-10: Close bottom-left and top-right, open bottom-right, and top-rear.
7. Day 14-15: Close bottom-right.
8. Leave undisturbed to allow a new queen to emerge.


Notes:
multiple (easy), vertical, increase optional, partial disruption
* Effectively a vertical Heddon
* Lots of steps to follow, but no need to open hive.
* Must have some drawn frames or bees will only work supers!
* May need to feed brood as losing foragers
</section>


<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## The Horsley Board

![Horsley Board QE open](img/horsley-closed.png "Horsley Board I")
![Horsley Board QE closed](img/horsley-open.png "Horsley Board II")

</section>


<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## The Horsley Method

1. Move the brood box to one side.
2. Place a new brood box on the floor containing drawn comb.
3. Transfer the Queen and 1-3 frames capped brood into it.
4. Add the Horsley board, entrance to the rear.
5. Close the entrance, opening the quen excluder and replace the original box.
6. After 3-4 days, open the entrance, closing the queen excluder.
7. Leave undisturbed to allow a new queen to emerge.

Notes:
multiple (easy), vertical, increase, partial disruption
* Like starting with demaree, ending with snelgrove
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## The Taranov Method

![Taranov](img/taranov.gif "Taranov")

Notes:
single, horizontal, increase, complete disruption
* Most 'natural' but quite invasive!
* Great method to get young bees for nucs etc, even if not splitting
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
## Bonus: Nucs &amp; The Circle Split

![Circle Split](img/circlesplit.gif "Circle Split")

Notes:
* Why only make 2 colonies?
* Making nucs is an easy way to weaken a colony
* circle split is the 'ultimate' increase method
* QCs either from swarming or from elsewhere (graftsing etc)
</section>

## Tips

* Be prepared
* Mix &amp; Match
* Queen Clipping
* Feeding
* Drawn Comb

Notes:
* know your timings, regular inspections, have equip and a plan ready
* M-M e.g. Start with demaree, switch to a solid floor (cheap horsley)
* Queen clipping allows 14 day inspections
* Feeding if using foundation is mandatory, helpful in some variations
* Drawn comb is the most valuable thing in the apiary
